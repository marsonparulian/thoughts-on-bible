# The Presence of Darkness
In the previous article, I explored the similarities in the biblical stories related to baptism. Upon further reflection, I noticed a recurring theme of darkness that appears before significant moments of divine intervention in these stories.

As with my other articles, my goal is not to lead readers to any specific conclusion but to highlight patterns found in the Scriptures for contemplation.

## In the Beginning
In Genesis 1:2, the Bible tells us that the earth was in a state of darkness before God began His creative work:

> (Genesis 1:2, NIV)
> "Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters."

This verse marks the beginning of creation, where the Spirit of God moves over the chaos and emptiness, and out of this darkness, God brings forth light and order. Darkness here is not seen as evil but as a prelude to the manifestation of God's power and creative act.

## The Great Flood
In the story of Noah’s flood, the beginning of the deluge is marked by heavy rain, which lasted forty days and nights:

> (Genesis 7:17, NIV)
> "For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased, they lifted the ark high above the earth."


While the Bible doesn’t explicitly mention darkness, the description of a long, intense rain likely implies a sky filled with thick clouds, which would have caused limited visibility and a sense of gloom or darkness. The flood itself, which symbolizes judgment, began in the midst of a seemingly dark and chaotic environment.

## Crossing the Red Sea
When the Israelites faced the Red Sea, the event is described with a strong east wind blowing through the night, which helped part the waters:

> (Exodus 14:21, NIV)
> "Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided."

Although the text doesn’t mention darkness explicitly, the fact that the wind blew through the night suggests that it was a time of darkness as the Israelites waited for the miraculous parting of the sea. The night’s darkness may have added to the tension and anticipation of the moment.

## Crossing the Jordan
Unlike the previous stories, the crossing of the Jordan River by the Israelites does not mention any darkness or clouds. The focus is primarily on the miracle of the river parting and the ark of the covenant leading the people:

> (Joshua 3:15-16, NIV)
> "Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water's edge, the water from upstream stopped flowing."

This event stands apart from the others in that it is not preceded by any symbolic reference to darkness or clouds, and the emphasis is on the faith and obedience of the people as they cross into the promised land.

## The Baptism of Jesus
When Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River, the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit descended like a dove. The text in Matthew 3:16 reads:

> (Matthew 3:16, NIV)
> "As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him."

While the Bible doesn’t mention clouds or darkness directly in this instance, it’s possible that when the heavens are described as opening, this event could have involved a parting of clouds—a phenomenon that would naturally cause a change in the surrounding light, potentially creating an atmosphere of both revelation and mystery. It’s worth considering that the moment of the opening of the heavens could have been accompanied by a level of darkness before the clouds parted, just as other divine interventions in Scripture have involved such imagery.

## No Conclusion

As I draw no definitive conclusions, I offer this reflection simply as a pattern to consider. In many stories related to baptism, such as in Genesis, the flood, and the Red Sea crossing, there seems to be a period of darkness or clouds before divine action takes place. The only exception is the crossing of the Jordan River, where no such mention occurs.

Some might think I’ve stretched the interpretation a bit in the case of Jesus' baptism, and that's valid. Still, it's worth pondering whether the opening of the heavens in that moment could have involved some degree of darkness or the parting of clouds, which would match the symbolic patterns seen in the other stories.

I hope this exploration encourages further thought and reflection. The Bible is rich with symbols and patterns, and in contemplating these, we can find new layers of understanding.
