# Bible Timeline

12 Feb 2025
 
## Objective
        Introduce timeline in the bible, starting from the most significant characters / events to more detailed events. 

## How
The timeline will have series of `node`, in which every node contains 1 or more keywords (character / event). 

At start, there will be few `node`. User can increase the `step` which will introduce 1 focus `node` in the timeline. After the `step` is increased, the `node.focused` will be switched to new `node`.

If the page is refreshed, the `step` must be persisted. So the `step` need to be persisted in the URL.

## Future Enhancement
There will be 1 or  more focused `node` which will replace `node` to give more detailed info. For instance: a "Moses, 10 Commandments", in certain step, could be replaced with "Moses, 10 Plagues", "Crossing the Red Sea", "10 Commandments", and "40 years in Wilderness" nodes.
