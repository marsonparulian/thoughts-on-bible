                    <h3>Moses' Birth</h3>
                    <p>
                        During a time of great oppression, the Pharaoh of Egypt ordered that all newborn Hebrew boys be
                        thrown into the Nile to control the growing Israelite population. Jochebed, a Hebrew woman, gave
                        birth to a son and, seeing his beauty and promise, hid him for three months. When she could no
                        longer keep him hidden, she placed him in a basket made of reeds and set it afloat on the Nile,
                        trusting God to protect him. His sister, Miriam, watched from a distance, hoping for a miracle.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Miriam</h3>
                    <p>As Moses floated down the river, his sister Miriam, a young girl, watched over him with care and
                        courage. When Pharaoh's daughter discovered the baby and showed compassion, Miriam boldly
                        approached and offered to find a Hebrew woman to nurse him. Though just a child, she played a
                        crucial role in God's plan, ensuring that Moses remained connected to his true heritage. Miriam
                        was likely at an age where she was still a virgin, similar to Mary, the mother of Jesus, who was
                        also a young girl chosen for a divine purpose.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Second in Command</h3>
                    <p>
                        Moses was raised as an Egyptian prince in Pharaohâ€™s palace, receiving the finest education and
                        training in leadership. As he grew, he gained status and authority, becoming a respected figure
                        in Egyptian society. Though he lived among royalty, he never forgot his Hebrew heritage.
                        Eventually, he rose to a high position, possibly second only to Pharaoh himself, gaining
                        influence and power.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stepping Down</h3>
                    <p>
                        Moses, once a powerful figure in Pharaohâ€™s palace, chose to leave behind his position and
                        privileges to stand with his oppressed people. He could no longer ignore their suffering, and in
                        a defining moment, he defended a fellow Hebrew, which led to his exile from Egypt. This
                        sacrifice mirrors the journey of Jesus, who stepped down from heaven to live as a humble man
                        among humanity. Just as Moses left his royal status to lead his people to freedom, Jesus left
                        His divine glory to save mankind.

                        Pharaoh's
                        daughter but later fled to Midian after killing an Egyptian. God called Moses to lead the

                        God parted the Red Sea so that the Israelites could escape from the pursuing Egyptian army. The
                        waters returned to their place, drowning the Egyptians.
