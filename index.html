                    Articles in this collection are a compilation of thoughts related to the Bible.
                    These articles are not intended to promote the belief that the Bible is a form of divine revelation.
                    Instead, they aim to explore the Bible as an ancient text written by many people over hundreds of years,
                    across various cultures and political systems.

                    These articles do not seek to advocate for the Christian faith,
                    but rather to observe patterns, symbolism, and messages conveyed through stories in the Bible,
                    written over a significant span of time.
