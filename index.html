            Articles in this collection are a compilation of thoughts related to the Bible.
            These articles are not intended to promote the belief that the Bible is a form of divine revelation.
            Instead, they aim to explore the Bible as an ancient text written by many people over hundreds of years,
            across various cultures and political systems.

        <p>
            These articles do not seek to advocate for the Christian faith,
            but rather to observe patterns, symbolism, and messages conveyed through stories in the Bible,
            written over a significant span of time.
