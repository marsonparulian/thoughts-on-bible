        <h1>Acts 16: Evangelism</h1>
<p>Acts 16 provides a remarkable account of how the Apostle Paul demonstrated different approaches to evangelism. Through preaching, the power of God, and his attitude and example, Paul touched lives and brought people to faith in Christ.  </p>
<h2>By Preaching</h2>
<p>One of the significant events in Acts 16 is Paul’s encounter with Lydia, a seller of purple cloth. While seeking a place to pray, Paul preached to a group of women gathered by the riverside. Lydia, described as a worshiper of God, had her heart opened by the Lord to accept Paul’s message. This moment highlights the transformative power of God’s Word when shared through faithful preaching. Lydia’s conversion is a reminder that evangelism begins with the proclamation of the gospel and relies on the Lord to prepare hearts to receive it.  </p>
<h2>By Power</h2>
<p>Paul also demonstrated God’s power when he rebuked and cast out a spirit of divination from a slave woman. This woman, who had been following Paul and his companions, was being exploited by her masters for fortune-telling. While on his way to prayer, Paul, filled with spiritual discernment, commanded the spirit to leave her in the name of Jesus Christ. The immediate deliverance of this woman shows how the power of God works through His servants to bring freedom and transformation to those in bondage. It also underscores the importance of boldness and spiritual authority in evangelism.  </p>
<h2>By Attitude and Example</h2>
<p>Paul’s conduct in prison is perhaps one of the most inspiring examples of evangelism in Acts 16. After being unjustly beaten and imprisoned, Paul and Silas responded not with anger or despair but by praying and singing hymns to God. Their faith and worship, even in suffering, created an atmosphere that led to a miraculous earthquake, opening the prison doors and loosening the prisoners’ chains. Despite the opportunity to escape, Paul chose to stay, which ultimately prevented the jailer from taking his own life. Touched by their integrity and the evident power of God, the jailer and his entire household came to faith in Christ. This story demonstrates how evangelism is not only about words but also about living out the gospel with integrity and faith, even in challenging circumstances.  </p>
<p>Acts 16 reveals that evangelism is multifaceted, requiring preaching to share the gospel, the power of God to demonstrate His authority, and Christlike character to draw others to faith. Each approach plays a vital role in advancing God’s kingdom and transforming lives.  </p>
