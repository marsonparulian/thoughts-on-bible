    # Not Abraham, Not Isaac

    ## Walk of Suffering

    Story in Genesis 22 - when Abraham obeyed the LORD by sacrificing his son Isaac, hold so many parallels with the story of the suffering and death of Jesus of Nazareth.

    ### Son Whom You Love
    The chapter begin when the LORD told Abraham "Take your son. Your only son Isaac. Whom you love. Take the mount of Moriah..." Divided by 3 parts, what God said has paired with the void from the sky when Jesus about to started his ministry -- after baptized: "This is my son. Whom I loved..."
    - The "Take your son,. Your only son Isaac" matched with "This ismy son". To Abraham hte LORD need to clarify which son should Abraham take. For the LORD Abraham has only i son of covenant. But for some readers Abraham has 2 biological sons.
    - The part "whom you love" matched "whom I love".
    - "Take your son to mount Muria.. " matches with  "He pleases me".The reason why it matched, because the greatest reason why Jesus as human pleases God the Father is trhough his obedience giving himself to be tortured and slaughtered on mount Muria.

    ### The Destination
    In the bible God told Abraham to go to the one out the mountains in land of Moriah. {{Explain why people believe that mount moriah is the same place with the Temple and where Jesus crucified}}

    ### 3 Days to mount Moriah
    Abraham took 3 days to reach mount Muoria. It matches with the the years  of Jesus ministry, from being baptized until crucifixtion on mount Moria. Many belive that Jesus ministry took 3 years because the number of passover event told in the one of the gospels.

    ### Two Young Men and A Donkey
    Abraham went to mount Moriah with Isaac, 2 young men and a donkey. It has paraalellism with the moment when Jesus told 2 of his diciples to fetch a donkey. The bible does not mention whether Isaac ride on a dongkey or not. But it is a possibility that a heart broken father feeling about to loose his son will tell the son to ride the donkey. This match the event Jesus rode a donkey entering Jerusalem. {{ Quote from bible when Jesus rode a donkey entering Jerusalem}}

    ### Stay and Watch
    Abraham told the 2 young men to stay and watch the donkey before he and Isaac continue the journey by foot - only the 2 of them. This has parallel when Jesus told hih diciples in Getsemane to stay and watchfull. After getsemene, Jesus started his walk of suffering by himself and the Father. 

    ### Similar Age
    Jesus and Isaac might have similar age when they are about sacrifized Many believe Jesus age was around 33 -34 years old. The bible does not mentioned the age of Isaacc. But we know, based on the age when Sara died, Isaac age was 37 or less. Most of Jewish tradition believe that Sarah died at 127 years old because she was shocked after knowing Isaac was about to be sacrifized, hence Isaac age was 37 years old. However th Jewish tradition does not have any more reason to backup the believe, besiade it is just a nature to connect the stories in the bible. Because the passage about death of Sara exactly after the trip to mount Moriah. Hence it is a possibility that Isaac age was similar to Jessu age which is 33 - 34 years old. One thing for sure, Isaac age need to be old enough to be able to carry full load of wood for sacrificial to burn a lamb. 

    ### Carry The Wood
    Jesus and Isaac both carried heavy load of wood on the way to the final destination on mount Moriah. Both wood are  going to be use used to attach their body as a sacrificial.

    ### No Resistance
    Both Jesus and Isaac did not resist when their was put down as a sacrificial object. Isaac, with a built body that strong enough to carry heavy load of wood was surely have enough strength to resist to a over 110 years old man.

    ### Blessing for the Whole World
    After the almost-sacrifition of Isaac, the LORD repeat one of this promise to Abraham: the whole world will receive blessing through his offspring, because Abraham is willing to sacrifice Isaac. This points to the surely-sacrifition of Jesus, Abraham offspring, that the world receives blessing.

    ## Covenant of the Pieces
    Few chapters early the LORD made a covenant with Abraham. They went on a well known by ancient worlds when 2 party are about to reach an agreement: Each party need to walk on between death animals as a sign that anyone who do not keep the promise will receive death. However Abraham was put to sleep, a darkness came down, and the LORD walk among the dead animals instead of Abraham.

    This is aligned with the story that instead of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, so that the whole word could receive blessing, god the Father sacrificed his own beloved son.

    In the book of Jubilee and Jewish tradition, the event of the Covenant of the Pieces is connected with the Passover. They happened on the same date and similar hour. In the Exodus, the passover lamb need to be sacrificed before the day ended, roughly between 3 to sunset.

    {{Quote from Exodus about when to sacrifice the Passover lamb}}

    Josephus, a know Jewish historian near time of Jesus mentioned the time of the sacrifiction :

    {{Quote from Josephus writing about the time of passover sacrifiction. What time of day it usually started and when it ends}}.

    There events happened in 2 specific time of the 14th day of Nissan:
    - Around 3 afternoon: Arguably the time Abraham prepare or kill the animals, the start of passover lambs being sacrificed in the temple, and the time Jesus died.
    - Before sunset: Abraham feel asleep and great terror and darkness fell, end of passover sacrifiction on the temple, and Jesus put in the tomb.

    ## The Sorrowed Suffering Father
    In the whole story of Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac, maybe the writer wants to show on how God the Father was very suffered and heart broken when he about to slughtered his own beloved only Son to give blessing to humanity. Many can only guess how did Abraham felt when he walk with Isaac for three days to mount Moriah. No one can imagine the trembling heart and sorrow Abraham felt when he led Isaac up the hill to be sacrificed. A family loving father is going to kill his son -- who he had been waiting for so long.

    But it was not Isaac. It was  Jesus. It was Jesus who felt the <em>cat of the nine tails</em> ribbed his skin and flesh. Who felt the torns went through his head. Who was stripped down and humiliated. It was Jesus' limbs who were pierced by nails -- not Isaac. It is a historical fact, that we know a person named Jesus of Nazareth went through one of the most horrific torture in that specific time and place.

    It was not Abraham.
