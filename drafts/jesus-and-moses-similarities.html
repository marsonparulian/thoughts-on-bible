        <h1>Similarities between Jesus and Moses</h1>
        <div class="creation-date">Created: December 8, 2024</div>
        <p>It came accros my mind one they: &quot;Why Aaron and his descendants are chosen to be the hight priest
            instead of Moses&quot;
            Then in some ways Aaron also a typograf of Jesus, as below:</p>


        <h2>Face to Face with God</h2>
        <p>
            Like it stated in Genesis 9:1-2, Moses was the only one who could face to face with God.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like it stated in Luke 24:51-52, Jesus was the only one who could face to face with God.
        </p>

        <h2>Received the Law</h2>
        <p>
            Moses received the law from God.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jesus received the law from God.
        </p>

        <h2>The Second Person</h2>
        <p>
            Moses was the second person in power after the Pharaoh.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jesus is the second person in the three persons of Trinity.
        </p>

        <h2>Kill the Enemy to Save his People</h2>
        <p>
            Moses killed the enemy, the egyptian guard, whose about to kill his people, an Israelites. After doing that
            Moses ran away, making himself outcasted. Away from the glory Moses had in the palace.
        </p>
        <p>
            As writtenin the book of Genesis where the seed of Eve will crush the head of the serpant,
            Jesus crush the enemy whose going to make his people to die. In order to do so Jesus had to leave the glory
            he has in heaven.
        </p>

        <h2>Massacres of babies</h2>
        <p>
            Both Moses and Jesus was about to be killed when they were still young.
            Moses was about to be killed by the Pharaoh, while Jesus was about to be killed by Herod.
            The two rulers were scared the prophecied baby would take their throne.
            As a result a lot of babies were massacred.
        </p>

        <h2>Looked After by Young Virgins</h2>
        <p>Miriam and Mary both are young virgins who looked after Moses and Jesus. The were make effort to save them
            the rulers who wants to kill Moses and Jesus while they are baby / infant.
            Even Miriam and Mary has similar names.
        </p>

        <h2>Their bodies were hidden</h2>
