        <h1>Moses and Elijah</h1>

        <div class="creation-date">Last updated: 28 May, 2025</div>

        <p>
            The Jewish Bible, or Tanakh, is divided into three parts: the Torah (the first five books), the Nevi'im (the
            Prophets), and the Ketuvim (the Writings, including Psalms, Proverbs, and historical texts).
        </p>

        <p>
            In Christian belief, Jesus is seen as the fulfillment of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Messiah who brings
            salvation and completes the prophecies of the Old Testament.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to
            fulfill them." (Matthew 5:17)
            "For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John." (Matthew 11:13)
            "Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms."
            (Luke 24:44)
        </p>

        <p>
            Moses represents the Law, and Elijah represents the Prophets. Their appearance together points to Jesus as
            the culmination of both, fulfilling the Law and the Prophets.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the transfiguration of Jesus, Moses and Elijah appear alongside him. This symbolizes the unity of the Old
            and New Testaments, showing Jesus as the bridge between them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below are a few key connections between Moses, Elijah, and Jesus.
        </p>

        <h2>Mount Sinai</h2>

        <p>
            Several important figures in the Bible encountered God on Mount Sinai, including Moses and Elijah.
        </p>

        <p>
            Moses received the Law on Mount Sinai, encountering God in a cloud and fire. Elijah also experienced God's
            presence on Mount Horeb (Sinai), where God spoke to him in a gentle whisper after wind, earthquake, and
            fire.
        </p>

        <h2>The Missing Body</h2>

        <p>
            Moses and Elijah are among the few whose bodies were not found, along with Enoch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moses died, but God hid his body. Likewise, Jesus died and was buried, yet his opponents could not find his
            body after the resurrection.
            Elijah was taken up to heaven without dying, prefiguring Jesus' ascension into heaven.
        </p>

        <h2>The Prophet</h2>

        <p>
            Moses foretold that God would raise up a prophet like him, urging the people to listen to this prophet.
        </p>

        <p>
            "The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You
            must listen to him." (Deuteronomy 18:15)
        </p>

        <p>
            Elijah is prophesied to return and prepare the way for the Messiah.
        </p>

        <p>
            "See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes." (Malachi
            4:5-6)
            "A voice of one calling: 'In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a
            highway for our God.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
        </p>

        <p>
            In Christian belief, the prophet like Moses and the Messiah are the same person: Jesus.
