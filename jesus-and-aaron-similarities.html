        <h1>Similarities between Jesus and Aaron</h1>
        <div class="creation-date">Created: November 20, 2024</div>
<p>It came accros my mind one they: &quot;Why Aaron and his descendants are chosen to be the hight priest instead of Moses&quot;
Then in some ways Aaron also a typograf of Jesus, as below:</p>
<h2>Aaron is the second person</h2>
<p>In the storyline of the salvation of the Israelites, 
Aaron is the second person after Moses. In the Trinitian believe Jesus is also the second person in the three persons of Trinity.</p>
<h2>The Word</h2>
<p>Aaron is the word of Moses when speaking with the Pharaoh. Jesus is also the word of God.</p>
