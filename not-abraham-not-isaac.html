    <h1>Not Abraham, Not Isaac</h1>

    <h2>Walk of Suffering</h2>

    <p>Story in Genesis 22 &ndash; when Abraham obeyed the LORD by sacrificing his son Isaac, holds so many parallels
        with the
        story of the suffering and death of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

    <h3>Son Whom You Love</h3>

    <p>The chapter begins when the LORD told Abraham:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a
            burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you." &ndash; Genesis 22:2</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This parallels the voice from heaven when Jesus was baptized and about to begin His ministry:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased." &ndash; Matthew 3:17 (NIV)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Divided into three parts, the Lord’s command to Abraham mirrors the voice from heaven after Jesus' baptism in the
        following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Take your son, your only son Isaac" matches with "This is my son". Abraham had two biological sons, but
            only Isaac was the son of the covenant.</li>
        <li>"Whom you love" matches "Whom I love".</li>
        <li>
            “Go to the land of Moriah, and offer him...” aligns with the part “With whom I am well pleased” — God’s
            pleasure in Jesus came through His obedience, especially in submitting to be crucified.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Destination</h3>
    <p>In the Bible, God told Abraham to go to one of the mountains in the land of Moriah. Many believe this is the same
        place where Solomon later built the Temple (2 Chronicles 3:1), and near the location of Golgotha where Jesus was
        crucified.</p>

    <h3>3 Days to Mount Moriah</h3>
    <p>Abraham took three days to reach Mount Moriah. This parallels the approximately three-year ministry of Jesus,
        from baptism to crucifixion.</p>

    <h3>Two Young Men and A Donkey</h3>
    <p>Abraham went with Isaac, two young men, and a donkey. This parallels Jesus telling two disciples to fetch a
        donkey:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying
            to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by
            her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them, and he
            will send them right away.”" &ndash; Matthew 21:1-3 (NIV)
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Bible doesn’t say whether Isaac rode a donkey, but a grieving father might have let his son ride. This
        matches Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a donkey.</p>

    <h3>Stay and Watch</h3>
    <p>Abraham told the two young men to stay behind while he and Isaac went alone. This parallels Jesus telling His
        disciples in Gethsemane:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Remain here and watch with me." – Matthew 26:38</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>After Gethsemane, Jesus began His journey of suffering, alone with the Father.</p>

    <h3>Similar Age</h3>
    <p>Jesus and Isaac may have been around the same age when they were to be sacrificed. Jesus was around 33 years old.
        The Bible doesn’t specify Isaac’s age, but Sarah died at 127 (Genesis 23:1), making Isaac around 37 or younger.
        Jewish tradition holds Sarah died from shock after the event, suggesting Isaac may have been 37 years old.</p>

    <h3>Carry The Wood</h3>
    <p>Jesus and Isaac both carried the wood meant for their sacrifice.</p>

    <h3>No Resistance</h3>
    <p>Both submitted without resistance. Isaac, strong enough to carry wood, could have resisted a 110-year-old man,
        but didn’t. Jesus also did not resist arrest or crucifixion.</p>

    <h3>Blessing for the Whole World</h3>
    <p>After nearly sacrificing Isaac, God said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"And in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice." –
            Genesis 22:18</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This points to Jesus, Abraham’s descendant, through whom the world is truly blessed.</p>

    <h2>Covenant of the Pieces</h2>

    <p>Earlier, God made a covenant with Abraham. Normally, both parties walk between dead animals to signify death upon
        breaking the covenant. But God alone passed through while Abraham slept:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"And when the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed
            between these pieces." &ndash; Genesis 15:17</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This foreshadows the Father sacrificing His own Son instead of Abraham sacrificing Isaac.</p>

    <p>According to the Book of Jubilees and Jewish tradition, this event occurred the same day and time as the first
        Passover. In Exodus:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of
            Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight." &ndash; Exodus 12:6</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Josephus, a historian born 37 AD, wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"...their sacrifices were performed from the ninth hour till the eleventh..." – Josephus, <em>Wars of the
                Jews</em>, Book 6, Chapter 9, Section 3</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Both of the writing shows when the passover lambs were sacrificed on the Temple.</p>

    <p>These events all happened on 2 specific hour on the 14th of month Nisan (Jewish calendar):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Around 3 PM &ndash; Arguably Abraham prepared the animals, lambs were sacrificed, and Jesus died.</li>
        <li>On twilight before sunset &ndash; Abraham fell asleep and darkness came, the Passover sacrifice ended, and
            Jesus was buried.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Sorrowed Suffering Father</h2>

    <p>Perhaps the writer of Genesis wanted to show the grief of God the Father, whose heart was torn when offering His
        Son. We can only guess Abraham’s sorrow walking with Isaac for three days. No one can fully grasp the heartbreak
        of leading a beloved son up a hill for sacrifice.</p>

    <p>
        But it was not Isaac. It was Jesus. Jesus &ndash; who felt the <em>cat of nine tails</em> shred His skin and
        flesh. Who wore acrown of thorns driven into His skull. Who was stripped, mocked, and humiliated in public. It
        was His hands and feet
        that were pierced by nails &ndash; not Isaac’s. This is no myth. It is a historical fact: a man named Jesus of
        Nazareth endured one of the most brutal tortures ever carried out in that time and place.
    </p>

    <p>And it was not Abraham..</p>
