        <h1>The Presence of Darkness</h1>

        <p>In the previous article, I explored the similarities in the biblical stories related to baptism. Upon further
            reflection, I noticed a recurring theme of darkness that appears before significant moments of divine
            intervention in these stories.</p>

        <p>As with my other articles, my goal is not to lead readers to any specific conclusion but to highlight
            patterns found in the Scriptures for contemplation.</p>

        <h2>In the Beginning</h2>
        <p>In Genesis 1:2, the Bible tells us that the earth was in a state of darkness before God began His creative
            work:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>(Genesis 1:2, NIV)<br>
                "Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God
                was hovering over the waters."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This verse marks the beginning of creation, where the Spirit of God moves over the chaos and emptiness, and
            out of this darkness, God brings forth light and order. Darkness here is not seen as evil but as a prelude
            to the manifestation of God's power and creative act.</p>

        <h2>The Great Flood</h2>
        <p>In the story of Noah's flood, the beginning of the deluge is marked by heavy rain, which lasted forty days
            and nights:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>(Genesis 7:17, NIV)<br>
                "For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased, they lifted the ark
                high above the earth."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>While the Bible doesn't explicitly mention darkness, the description of a long, intense rain likely implies a
            sky filled with thick clouds, which would have caused limited visibility and a sense of gloom or darkness.
            The flood itself, which symbolizes judgment, began in the midst of a seemingly dark and chaotic environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Crossing the Red Sea</h2>
        <p>When the Israelites faced the Red Sea, the event is described with a strong east wind blowing through the
            night, which helped part the waters:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>(Exodus 14:21, NIV)<br>
                "Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a
                strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Although the text doesn't mention darkness explicitly, the fact that the wind blew through the night suggests
            that it was a time of darkness as the Israelites waited for the miraculous parting of the sea. The night's
            darkness may have added to the tension and anticipation of the moment.</p>

        <h2>Crossing the Jordan</h2>
        <p>Unlike the previous stories, the crossing of the Jordan River by the Israelites does not mention any darkness
            or clouds. The focus is primarily on the miracle of the river parting and the ark of the covenant leading
            the people:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>(Joshua 3:15-16, NIV)<br>
                "Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark
                reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water's edge, the water from upstream stopped flowing."
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This event stands apart from the others in that it is not preceded by any symbolic reference to darkness or
            clouds, and the emphasis is on the faith and obedience of the people as they cross into the promised land.
        </p>

        <h2>The Baptism of Jesus</h2>
        <p>When Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River, the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit descended like a dove.
            The text in Matthew 3:16 reads:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>(Matthew 3:16, NIV)<br>
                "As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he
                saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>While the Bible doesn't mention clouds or darkness directly in this instance, it's possible that when the
            heavens are described as opening, this event could have involved a parting of clouds—a phenomenon that would
            naturally cause a change in the surrounding light, potentially creating an atmosphere of both revelation and
            mystery. It's worth considering that the moment of the opening of the heavens could have been accompanied by
            a level of darkness before the clouds parted, just as other divine interventions in Scripture have involved
            such imagery.</p>

        <h2>Jesus Walks on Water</h2>

        <p>When Jesus walked on water and declared, "I am He," I believe He was alluding to the story in Genesis 1,
            where the Spirit of God hovered over the waters of chaos. This connection signifies that Jesus was
            identifying Himself as one with the Spirit of God described in Genesis 1.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>That evening, Jesus' disciples went down to the sea, got into the boat, and started across the sea to
                Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. The sea became rough because a strong
                wind was blowing. When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and
                coming near the boat, and they were frightened. But He said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid." (John
                6:16-20 ESV)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Similarly, in Genesis 1, the setting was one of darkness over the waters of chaos. In both accounts, we see
            the presence of darkness and God’s power over the waters.</p>

        <h2>No Conclusion</h2>
        <p>As I draw no definitive conclusions, I offer this reflection simply as a pattern to consider. In many stories
            related to baptism, such as in Genesis, the flood, and the Red Sea crossing, there seems to be a period of
            darkness or clouds before divine action takes place. The only exception is the crossing of the Jordan River,
            where no such mention occurs.</p>

        <p>Some might think I've stretched the interpretation a bit in the case of Jesus' baptism, and that's valid.
            Still, it's worth pondering whether the opening of the heavens in that moment could have involved some
            degree of darkness or the parting of clouds, which would match the symbolic patterns seen in the other
            stories.</p>

        <p>I hope this exploration encourages further thought and reflection. The Bible is rich with symbols and
            patterns, and in contemplating these, we can find new layers of understanding.</p>
