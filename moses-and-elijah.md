# Moses and Elijah

Two prophets appear during the transfiguration of Jesus: Moses and Elijah.

> **"Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus."**  
> *(Matthew 17:3, NIV)*

## The Law and the Prophets
Moses is often seen as representing the Law, while Elijah represents the Prophets. The Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh (the Old Testament), is divided into three main sections:  
1. **The Law (Torah)**  
2. **The Prophets (Nevi'im)**  
3. **The Writings (Ketuvim)**  

This structure highlights the significance of both Moses and Elijah, who together symbolize the full testimony of God's revelation to Israel.

## Similarities Between Moses and Elijah
There are notable parallels between Moses and Elijah:

### 1. Went Up to a Mountain to Speak with the Lord
Both Moses and Elijah ascended mountains to encounter God:  
- **Moses** went up to **Mount Sinai** (also called Mount Horeb) to receive the Law. *(Exodus 19:20-25, Exodus 24:12-18)*  
- **Elijah** went to **Mount Horeb** and heard God's voice in a gentle whisper. *(1 Kings 19:8-13)*  

> **"The Lord said to Moses, 'Come up to me on the mountain and stay here, and I will give you the tablets of stone with the law and commands I have written for their instruction.'”**  
> *(Exodus 24:12, NIV)*  

> **"The Lord said, 'Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by.'”**  
> *(1 Kings 19:11, NIV)*  

### 2. Lived in the Desert
Both Moses and Elijah lived in the wilderness and were sustained by God's provision:  
- **Moses** and the Israelites were miraculously provided for in the desert for 40 years. God gave them **manna**, bread from heaven, to eat. *(Exodus 16:4-35)*  
  > **"Then the Lord said to Moses, 'I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day.'”** *(Exodus 16:4, NIV)*  
  Despite the barren conditions, God ensured they lacked nothing: their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell. *(Deuteronomy 8:4)*  

- **Elijah** was provided for during his time in the wilderness. At one point, ravens brought him bread and meat, and he drank from a brook. *(1 Kings 17:6)* Later, an angel of the Lord gave Elijah food that sustained him for 40 days and nights as he traveled to Mount Horeb. *(1 Kings 19:5-8)*  
  > **"Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, 'Get up and eat.' He looked around, and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals and a jar of water."** *(1 Kings 19:5-6, NIV)*  

Other Bible figures also spent time in the desert:  
- **King David**, when fleeing from **Saul**. *(1 Samuel 23:14)*  
- **John the Baptist**, who preached in the wilderness to prepare the way for Jesus. *(Matthew 3:1-3)*  
- **Jesus**, who fasted for 40 days and was tempted in the wilderness. *(Matthew 4:1-2)*  

### 3. Prepared but Did Not Experience the Promised Fulfillment
- **Moses** prepared the Israelites to enter the Promised Land but only saw it from afar. He did not enter it himself. *(Deuteronomy 34:1-4)*  
  > The Israelites were led into the Promised Land by **Joshua**, whose name shares the same root as "Jesus" (both derived from the Hebrew name "Yehoshua," meaning "The Lord saves").  

- **Elijah**, through John the Baptist (in the spirit of Elijah), prepared the way for Jesus but did not witness Jesus' death and resurrection. *(Matthew 11:10-14)*  

This parallels God's promise of salvation:  
> **"And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."**  
> *(Genesis 3:15, NIV)*  

This prophecy was fulfilled when Jesus defeated sin and death through His sacrifice on the cross.

### 4. Bodies Were Not Found
Both Moses and Elijah have mysterious departures:  
- **Moses' body** was hidden by God, and no one knows where he was buried. *(Deuteronomy 34:5-6)*  
- **Elijah** was taken to heaven in a chariot of fire without experiencing death. *(2 Kings 2:11)*  

> **"And Moses the servant of the Lord died there in Moab, as the Lord had said. He buried him in Moab... but to this day no one knows where his grave is."**  
> *(Deuteronomy 34:5-6, NIV)*  

> **"As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind."**  
> *(2 Kings 2:11, NIV)*
